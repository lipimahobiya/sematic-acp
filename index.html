                                <h1>Fruits</h1>
                                <p>In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (angiosperms) that is formed from the ovary after
                                flowering (see Fruit anatomy).
                                
                                Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long propagated
                                using the movements of humans and other animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the
                                one group and nutrition for the other; humans, and many other animals, have become dependent on fruits as a source of
                                food.[1] Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as
                                the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.
                                
                                In common language and culinary usage, fruit normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants
                                that typically are sweet (or sour) and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and
                                strawberries. In botanical usage, the term fruit also includes many structures that are not commonly called as such in
                                everyday language, such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.[2][3]

                                An arrangement of fruits commonly thought of as culinary vegetables, including corn (maize), tomatoes, and various
                                squash
                                Many common language terms used for fruit and seeds differ from botanical classifications. For example, in botany, a
                                fruit is a ripened ovary or carpel that contains seeds, e.g., an orange, pomegranate, tomato or a pumpkin. A nut is a
                                type of fruit (and not a seed), and a seed is a ripened ovule.[4]
                                
                                In culinary language, a fruit is the sweet- or not sweet- (even sour-) tasting produce of a specific plant (e.g., a
                                peach, pear or lemon); nuts are hard, oily, non-sweet plant produce in shells (hazelnut, acorn). Vegetables, so-called,
                                typically are savory or non-sweet produce (zucchini, lettuce, broccoli, and tomato). but some may be sweet-tasting
                                (sweet potato).[5]

                                Examples of botanically classified fruit that are typically called vegetables include cucumber, pumpkin, and squash (all
                                are cucurbits); beans, peanuts, and peas (all legumes); and corn, eggplant, bell pepper (or sweet pepper), and tomato.
                                Many spices are fruits, botanically speaking, including black pepper, chili pepper, cumin and allspice.[4] In contrast,
                                rhubarb is often called a fruit when used in making pies, but the edible produce of rhubarb is actually the leaf stalk
                                or petiole of the plant.[6] Edible gymnosperm seeds are often given fruit names, e.g., ginkgo nuts and pine nuts.
                                
                                Botanically, a cereal grain, such as corn, rice, or wheat is a kind of fruit (termed a caryopsis). However, the fruit
                                wall is thin and fused to the seed coat, so almost all the edible grain-fruit is actually a seed.[7]</p>
